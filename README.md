# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab + Honeynet üçØ 

![final map](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab/assets/140366635/cd438962-f370-40f5-9a5d-2a8034c579de)



## Introduction/Goals

This project involves creating an exposed Honeynet in the Microsoft Azure Cloud to observe how real cyber threat actors attempt to break into vulnerable networks on a continuous basis. Upon observation of the attacks, we will practice the incident response process with NIST 800-61 and implement security controls with NIST 800-53 by using the security tools available in Microsoft Azure. The end goal is to effectively emulate a security incident response action plan from a SOC perspective in a cloud environment.  



## Observation Methods

The log analytics workspace imports a wide variety of security logs from our assets in  Azure. Any anomalies or security events are logged from our endpoints and imported into our log analytical workspace for querying.

The Azure Honeynet was unprotected for 24 hours to observe the cyber attacks in certain metrics with the logs ingested. Security controls were then implemented to harden the environment, and after another 24 hours the logs were measured again. The metrics measured by logs are:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

Microsoft Sentinel will utilize these logs ingested in the analytical workspace to construct a heat map from the geographical sources of the attacks, create alerts, and advertise incidents to our defenders.

## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls
![Unsecured Network](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab/assets/140366635/768fa3df-0c0e-4062-8369-3223d4336e0b)

To allow attacks into the network for observation, the azure virtual network was left unprotected at multiple levels.  All Azure assets were public facing to the internet and were available directly to cyber threat actors. 

Our Assets include:
- Windows 10 Server hosting SQL Database
- Ubuntu  20.04.6 Server
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Blob Storage (Storage Account)

No Azure firewall was configured for the network, a Network Service Group (NSG) covering the network with our assets was left open to any traffic, both the Windows & Ubuntu virtual machines had NSGs open to any traffic, and lastly the respective firewalls for each asset were disabled. The operating system firewalls for Windows and Ubuntu were not configured, and the network rule settings for our Blob Storage and Key Vault were available to be viewed from any public space, without the security tool Azure Private Endpoints configured.

**Threat:**  Malicious Cyber Actors Online

**Vulnerability:**  No Firewalls or Networks Service Groups configured 

**Risk:**  Remote Login available to threat actors brute forcing into publicly exposed Virtual Machines, and public access/viewing of our Blob Storage and Key Vault.

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls
![Secured Network Azure firewall](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab/assets/140366635/c9fea765-11bc-48af-a9ac-36a0e9c6b6d7)

During the Containment, Eradication and Recovery Phase of the incident lifecycle, I hardened the network by implementing security controls focused on NIST 800 53 R5 SC-7 Boundary Protection. 

- **Azure Firewall** - I configured and set an Azure Firewall to set only authorized IP addresses to remote into the Virtual Machines and only configured certain website traffic to be allowed. All other traffic is denied by default with Azure firewalls.  A default route and separate Azure subnet was created to route all internal traffic directly through the firewall, and all external traffic must be filtered through the firewall before going internal to the assets.

- **Virtual Network Network Service Group (NSG)** - I configured a Network Service Group spanning the entire virtual network to only accept inbound traffic from authorized IP addresses. 

- **Virtual Machine Network Service Group (NSG)** - I configured a Network Service Group specific to each Virtual Machine (Windows & Ubuntu) to only accept inbound traffic from authorized IP addresses. 

- **Operating System Firewalls** - I configured each VM‚Äôs respective Operating System Firewall to only accept inbound remote logins from authorized IP addresses.

   Windows 10: Windows Firewall 

   Ubuntu: UFW Firewall 

- **Private Endpoints** - I configured public access to disabled for Azure Key Vault and Blob Storage. Private endpoint access was configured to only allow access to these resources from within the virtual network, and deny access from public IP space.

## Conclusion

While learning how Microsoft's Azure Cloud models operate, I built a small Honey Net and SOC environment to capture the logs that were generated and integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Using Microsoft Sentinel, incidents were triaged and investigated, and controls were implemented based on NIST 800-53 R5 SC-7. Log metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures.

Implementing security controls solely based on Boundary Protection (SC-7 of NIST 800-53) improved the overall network security posture by 27% according to Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs Secure score (54% increased to 81%). Our tables that show before and after security events with drastic reductions demonstrate how effective these network controls are in securing an environment.

It‚Äôs important to state that in a real life enterprise network environment with much more factors to consider, it‚Äôs likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
